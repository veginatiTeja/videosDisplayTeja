How did you structure the app based on the requirements?


-> Building these project using create-react-app it's best way to build single page applications in react
-> It sets up building enviornment using latest javascript features
-> create our folder structure for making react app 
-> run the command in terminal npm install -g create-react-app 
-> it installs all the necessary dependencies and packages will install and added package.json file
->Any react app contains different modules like node_modules , public folder, src folder , package.json file etc
->public folder contain all images, assets, icons
->src folder contain all react components will render in the UI 
-> first step follows the rule: Most React projects start with a src/ folder and one src/App.js file with an App component.
   It's a function component which just renders JSX:
-> A component is reusable and also composable means a component is child component to parent component
->Inside App component we use videoList component 
-src/
--- App.js 
--- components/ 
          ---videoList.js 
-Next the src/App.js file can import the videoList component and use it:
-and videoList.js file we can export the videoList component 
-I am using a class component that extends react component and render method return tha JSX and displayed in the ui 
- videos data are maintained in the list of objects 
- maintaining the state object whenever change in the objects
-using setState method updating the ui and whenever state changes 
- using select input element for maintain the list of videos
-using React-player third party package we display the youtube videos and paths etc 
-displaying the meta tags of videos 
-so overall functionality is whenever option changes drop down in select box corresponding video is playing and meta data also displayed



2) Did you use any libraryâ€™s and why did you choose to use them?

ReactJS itself is an example of a JavaScript library
A JavaScript Library is a pre-written JavaScript file with some extremely useful code-snippets, objects, and functions so that we can reuse the functions, objects, and code-snippets to perform a common task.

3) How long did it take you to complete the project?
  I built a React project in less than a day for understanding and design the project

4) Are there any limitations to your solution, what might cause it to fail in a real-world
application?
 one limitation there I am facing the issue 
 according to search input video list is not updating
 in the search bar searchInput is updating 

 5)How would you improve it if you had more time?
 I would able to solve my search input limitation and adding some design and styling
